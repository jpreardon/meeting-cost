# Meeting Cost

Every so often, I think that putting the ever up-ticking cost of meetings front and center would make them shorter. I had this idea for a [real-time meeting calculator](https://jpreardon.com/2016/01/15/idea-real-time-meeting-cost-calculator/) a while ago. It is far from an original idea, many others have gone before me. Anyway, I was inspired again today, enough to start something. This is that something.

Only some screen concepts so far...
